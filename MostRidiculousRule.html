      <h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
      <p>One time a police officer came in with a dog to inform us about their job. During their talk one thing sounded very bizzare.  In Paulding, Ohio, it is legal for a policeman to bite the dog if it will get him to calm down.</p>
        <h2> My Opinion</h2>
        <p>I think this inhumane and not necessary. There are many other ways to get a dog to calm down that does not involve any harm or pain.</p>
